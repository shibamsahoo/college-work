<h3>Early Life and Education</h3>
Rabindranath Tagore was born into an influential Bengali family deeply engaged in cultural and intellectual pursuits. From an early age, he was exposed to literature, music, and philosophy.

Tagore was a prodigious writer from childhood, publishing poems and short stories by his teens. His deep cultural roots combined with exposure to Western ideas shaped his unique literary voice.

<h3>Literary Contributions</h3>
Tagore reshaped Bengali literature and music. His poetry collection <b>“Gitanjali”</b> (Song Offerings) brought him international fame and earned him the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1913. He wrote over <b>2,000 songs</b>, plays, short stories, novels, and essays — many of which explored humanism, nationalism, and spirituality.

He also composed the <b>national anthems of India (“Jana Gana Mana”) and Bangladesh (“Amar Shonar Bangla”)</b>, and inspired Sri Lanka's national anthem as well.

<h3>Education and Santiniketan</h3>
