<h3>Early Life and Education</h3>
Subhas Chandra Bose was born into a well-educated Bengali family. His father was a prominent lawyer. From an early age, Subhas was known for his sharp intellect and patriotic zeal. He studied at the Presidency College and later at the Scottish Church College in Kolkata. He went to England to prepare for the Indian Civil Services (ICS), which he passed with merit. However, he resigned from the ICS in 1921 to join the Indian freedom struggle under Mahatma Gandhi.

<h3>Freedom Struggle and Ideology</h3>
Bose was a revolutionary who believed that only armed struggle could achieve independence. Although initially associated with the Indian National Congress, he differed with Gandhi's non-violence approach. He became President of the Congress in 1938 and 1939 but later resigned due to ideological conflicts.

His vision was of a free and industrially strong India. He advocated for complete and immediate independence and did not shy away from seeking help from Axis powers during World War II.

<h3>Formation of Indian National Army (INA)</h3>
While in exile, Bose formed the Azad Hind Government and raised the Indian National Army (INA) with the support of Japan. He addressed INA soldiers with powerful words:

"Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom!"

The INA fought valiantly against the British in Northeast India. Although the military campaign didn’t succeed, Bose’s leadership inspired millions and instilled a sense of pride and nationalism among Indians.

- Complete and uncompromising independence for India
